## Prompts Used to Develop the Roadmap and Understand the Project Approach (via ChatGPT):

- Letâ€™s build a ROADMAP of the project in an organized way, starting with creating a Python Flask application, and from there continue through all the steps up to full deployment on Azure with automation. Suggest the steps in a logical order, including what needs to be done at each stage and the main considerations. Explain to me how to carry out all these steps step by step in a clear way so that I can present them visually.

- Letâ€™s start with the Flask application â€” what should the folder structure look like? Later weâ€™ll adjust everything related to Azure. Note that afterwards Iâ€™ll need to deploy the whole application on Azure, so it has to be suitable.

- Is this how itâ€™s supposed to look in the GitHub repo?

Using these prompts, I understood how to approach the project and what to do at each stage. Afterwards, I created the roadmap visually.

## Prompt for the flask app (GitHub Copilot):
Create a complete Python Flask web application that will later be deployed to Azure. Follow these requirements:

1. Web Interface:
   - A form where users can input their name and a city.
   - A "Get Weather" button that fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
   - Display the next 5 forecasts in a clean and readable table on the same page.
   - Handle errors if the city is not found.

2. Database:
   - Use PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy.
   - Save user name, city, weather data, and timestamp in a table.
   - Prepare the database connection using an environment variable (e.g., DATABASE_URL) so it can be replaced with Azure PostgreSQL later.
   - Include code to automatically create the table if it does not exist.

3. Project Structure:
   - app.py for the main Flask app.
   - templates/index.html for the HTML page.
   - static/style.css for optional styling.
   - Configurable API key for OpenWeatherMap using an environment variable.

4. Azure-readiness:
   - Use environment variables for all secrets (API key, DB URL).
   - Clean, modular, well-commented code.
   - Include instructions in comments on how to run locally and how to prepare for deployment to Azure App Service with Azure PostgreSQL.

5. Output:
   - Provide the complete app.py, templates/index.html, and optionally static/style.css.
   - Include example .env file format with placeholders for API key and DB URL.

## Prompt to test if the flask app works (ChatGPT):

Explain step by step how to check if my Python app works in VS Code, including how to create a test file, run it in the integrated terminal, and confirm that everything is set up correctly


I'm in step 2 in the road map. Do I need to change the code on github to be without sqlite?

ðŸ‘‰ Short answer: No, you donâ€™t have to remove SQLite from the code on GitHub.
Hereâ€™s why:
For local development: keeping sqlite:///weather.db is super convenient â€” you donâ€™t need to run a database server every time you test.
For production on Azure: youâ€™ll set the DATABASE_URL environment variable to point to your Azure PostgreSQL connection string.
âœ… Best practice for GitHub:
Keep both options in the code (donâ€™t hardcode Postgres).


## OIDC / GitHub Actions

Step-by-step summary of what we did in this chat:

1. Set up OIDC GitHub â†’ Azure:

- Registered an app in Microsoft Entra ID

- Created a federated credential for GitHub Actions

- Retrieved AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID

2. Configured GitHub Actions CI/CD:

- Used azure/login with OIDC instead of secrets

- Fixed warnings about deprecated set-output

- Encountered missing requirements.txt

3. Deployed Flask app to Azure Web App:

- Deployment worked but no content showed up

- Checked deployment logs in App Service â†’ Deployment Center

- Identified missing code / slot mismatch issue

4. Fixed API key issue:

- Added OpenWeatherMap API key as an App Setting in Azure Web App â†’ Configuration

- App still threw 401 errors â†’ checked env variable handling
